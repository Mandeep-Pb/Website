            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hockey is a team sport played on ice, where two teams of skaters compete to score 	goals by propelling a puck into the opponent's net. While there are variations of the 	game, the most widely recognized form is ice hockey, played predominantly in North 	America, Europe, and parts of Asia. Field hockey, another variant, is popular in 	countries like India, the Netherlands, and Australia.

	Ice hockey is characterized by its fast-paced nature, requiring players to skate with 	precision, handle the puck deftly, and collaborate seamlessly with their teammates. The 	sport has a passionate following and is celebrated in leagues such as the National 	Hockey League (NHL) in North America and the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in Russia, 	among others..</p>

        <section id="origins">
            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>The origins of hockey can be traced back to ancient civilizations. While the 	modern game we know today took shape in the 19th century, early forms of the sport were 	played as far back as the Egyptians and Greeks. The Native Americans also played a game 	called "shinty" on frozen ponds, using sticks and a ball.

	However, it was in Canada that ice hockey truly began to take shape. In the mid-19th 	century, Canadians adapted the game of field hockey to the icy conditions of their 	country. This adaptation marked the birth of ice hockey. The first recorded indoor game 	was played in 1875 in Montreal, Quebec, solidifying Canada's role as the cradle of 	hockey.</p>

            <h2>Modern Era</h2>
            <p>Hockey's modern era has been defined by innovation and globalization. In the early 20th century, the sport gained international recognition, with Canada, the United States, and European countries leading the way. The introduction of the forward pass, goal nets, and player substitutions further refined the game.

The National Hockey League (NHL), founded in 1917, became the premier professional hockey league, attracting the best talent from around the world.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the "Miracle on Ice" at the 1980 Winter Olympics, where the U.S. defeated the heavily favored Soviet Union, showcased the sport's ability to captivate audiences on a global scale.</p>

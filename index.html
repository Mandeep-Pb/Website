        <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> <strong> Hockey is a team sport played on ice, where two teams of  skaters compete to score goals by propelling a puck into the opponent's net. While there are  variations of the game, the most widely recognized form is ice hockey, played predominantly in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. Field hockey, another variant, is popular in 	countries like India, the Netherlands, and Australia.
 
	Ice hockey is characterized by its fast-paced nature, requiring players to skate with 	precision, handle the puck deftly, and collaborate seamlessly with their teammates. The 	sport has a passionate following and is celebrated in leagues such as the National 	Hockey League (NHL) in North America and the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in Russia, 	among others. </strong></p>
